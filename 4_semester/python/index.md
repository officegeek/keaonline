# Virtual Environment
The **venv** module provides support for creating lightweight "*virtual environments*" with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories.

Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (*matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment*) and can have its own **independent set of installed Python packages** in its site directories.

# Dashboard
Dash apps give a point-&-click interface to models written in Python, vastly expanding the notion of what's possible in a traditional "dashboard".
With Dash apps, data scientists and engineers put complex Python analytics in the hands of business decision-makers and operators.
