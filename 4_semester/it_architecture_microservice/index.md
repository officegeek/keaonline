# Microservice
A microservice architecture – A variant of the service-oriented architecture (**SOA**) – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services.

In a microservice architecture, services are **fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight**. 

The goal is that teams can bring their services to life independent of others. **Loose coupling reduces all types of dependencies** and the complexities around it, as service developers do not need to care about the users of the service, they do not force their changes onto users of the service.

The microservice architecture brings the idea of **decoupling functional parts of software applications into lightweight, deployable solutions, each having its own goal in the general ecosystem**.

# RabbitMQ
Think of a message broker (*RabbitMQ*) like a delivery person who takes mail from a sender and delivers it to the correct destination.
