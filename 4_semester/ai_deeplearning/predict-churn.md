# Predict Churn
How to predict churn, using deep learning.

## Customer base churn
Churn rate, when applied to a customer base, refers to the proportion of contractual customers or subscribers who leave a supplier during a given time period.

It is a possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having to do with the customer life cycle.

## Steps
1. Build a simple Tensorflow model to predict Churn
2. Training the model and make predictions on test data with Pandas
3. Save your model to disc and reload it to a Jupyter Notebook for reuse
