# DAX
DAX stands for Data Analysis Expressions, i.e. such expressions or formulas that are used for data analysis and calculations.

DAX formulas are very useful in Power BI, as they help data analysts to use the data sets they have to the fullest potential. DAX is used in Power BI, Excel, Power Pivot and also in Analysis Services.

DAX is a data functional language which has several prebuilt functions, operators and methods which allow us to do calculations on data as well as transformations on it.
